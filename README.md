CalculatorApp
CalculatorApp is a simple JavaFX-based calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was created following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to ensure a clear separation between the application's logic, user interface, and data management.

Features
Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear Button (AC): Resets the display and clears all inputs.
Sign Toggle (+/-): Switches the sign of the displayed number.
Percentage Calculation (%): Computes the percentage of a number.
Error Handling: Manages invalid inputs and prevents division by zero errors.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive layout for easy interaction.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Копировать код
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CalculatorApp.git
Open the project in your preferred IDE.
Make sure you have JavaFX installed or properly configured in your project.
Run the Main class to launch the application.
Usage
Use the number buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
Select an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /) to perform.
Press = to see the result.
Use AC to clear the display or +/- to toggle the sign of the current number.
Use % for percentage calculations.
MVC Architecture
Model: Handles the calculator’s data and logic.
View: Represents the user interface (buttons, display).
Controller: Connects the Model and View, managing user input and updating the display accordingly.
Error Handling
The application includes error handling for common scenarios, including division by zero. If an error occurs, it displays an error message on the screen.
